===================

Course project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' taken on Coursera during August 2014.
This project is based off data collected from accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphones being worn by test subjects. The purpose of the project is to clean the data so that it is ready for further analysis. Documenting this cleaning process is another essential step which makes up the CodeBook.md file in this repository.
