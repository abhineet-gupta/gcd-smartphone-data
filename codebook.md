 [1] "subject"                    
 *Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.*  
 
 [2] "activity_desc"              
 *Activities performed by the subjects. Include the following 6 values:*  
	1. WALKING  
	2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
	3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
	4. SITTING  
	5. STANDING  
	6. LAYING  
	
Following values are the **average means** of the features from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. A prefix of 't' represents values in the time-domain whereas an 'f' is that of the frequency domain. All values are normalised and hence in the range [-1, 1]
